# CovidARIMA
The repository with my code for modelling COVID-19 daily cases using ARIMA processes in R.

There are multiple files. The R-file with the code, and a markdown file created with RMarkdown to give the reader an introduction to ARIMA processes, and comment the code and its output.

I have noticed some issues with the mathematical notation. Please download the html or RMarkdown file to get the full experience, or follow this link:
